## Description

Pig Dice is a simple dice game where two users take turns rolling a die until either a 1 is rolled, or the player decides to "hold". If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the other player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
